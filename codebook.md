## Introduction

This code contains the function run_analysis.R which takes in raw Samsung fitness data and produces a large data frame called pig_data and a smaller, tidier data frame called tidy_data. This is output to a text file tidy_data.txt. It assumes that the data is contained in a subdirectory called UCI_HAR_Dataset in the working directory.

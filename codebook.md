This codebook describes the two data frames that this code generates

#pig_data data frame

This is the larger of the two data frames. The first column lists the subject, the second column identifies the activity by its names as listed in the file "activity_labels.txt". Each row corresponds to the measurements made in a single time-window by the Samsung device. Therefore, the same combination of subject and activity appears multiple times, since multiple windows of sampling are present in the data.

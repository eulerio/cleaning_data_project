#What does the code do?
This is a function run_analysis.R which takes in raw data from Samsung fitness monitors. It assumes that the data is present in the working directory in a sub-directory called UCI_HAR_Dataset. It produces a large data frame called pig_data and another smaller and tidier data frame called tidy_data. This tidy_data is written as a table to a text file "tidy_data.txt"
